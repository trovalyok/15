Admin Access Decorator (is_admin): Ensures that functions can only be called by users with the role of 'admin'. It raises a ValueError if the user role is not 'admin'.

Try-Except Error Printer Decorator (catch_errors): Wraps functions in a try-except block to catch and print any errors that occur during execution.

Type Validation Decorator (check_types): Validates input arguments and return types of a function based on type annotations. It raises a TypeError if any type mismatches are found.

Function Result Cache System Decorator (cache_results): Caches the result of a function based on its input arguments. If the same arguments are provided again, it returns the cached result instead of re-executing the function.

Rate-Limiter Decorator (rate_limiter): Limits the number of times a function can be called within a specific time frame (one minute). It prints a message if the rate limit is exceeded.
